       " {'ingredient': 'vodka',\n",
       "  'description': 'Vodka is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and ethanol, sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings. Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of fermented cereal grains or potatoes, though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1890s, the standard Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Czech vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume ABV (80 US proof), a percentage that is widely misattributed to Dmitri Mendeleev. The European Union has established a minimum of 37.5% ABV for any \"European vodka\" to be named as such. Products sold as \"vodka\" in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%. Even with these loose restrictions, most vodka sold contains 40% ABV. For homemade vodkas and distilled beverages referred to as \"moonshine\", see moonshine by country.\\r\\n\\r\\nVodka is traditionally drunk neat (not mixed with any water, ice, or other mixer), though it is often served chilled in the vodka belt countries (Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine). It is also commonly used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, Screwdriver, Greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow Mule, and Bloody Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nScholars debate the beginnings of vodka. It is a contentious issue because very little historical material is available. For many centuries, beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today, as the spirit at that time had a different flavor, color and smell, and was originally used as medicine. It contained little alcohol, an estimated maximum of about 14%, as only this amount can be attained by natural fermentation. The still, allowing for distillation (\"burning of wine\"), increased purity, and increased alcohol content, was invented in the 8th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration prior to any additional processing including the addition of flavorants. Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation, as well as afterwards, where the distilled vodka is filtered through activated charcoal and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off-flavors to the vodka. However, this is not the case in the traditional vodka-producing nations, so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering, thus preserving the unique flavors and characteristics of their products.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration, which includes the removal of the \"fore-shots\", \"heads\" and \"tails\". These components of the distillate contain flavor compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate (heads) as well as the fusel oils (tails) that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka. Through numerous rounds of distillation, or the use of a fractioning still, the taste is modified and clarity is increased. In contrast, distillery process for liquors such as whiskey, rum, and baijiu allow portions of the \"heads\" and \"tails\" to remain, giving them their unique flavors.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users, whether legislation determines strength limits or not. Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the stillmaster, the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95–96% ethanol. As such, most vodka is diluted with water prior to bottling.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolish distilleries make a very pure (96%, 192 proof, formerly also 98%) rectified spirit (Polish language: spirytus rektyfikowany). Technically a form of vodka, it is sold in liquor stores rather than pharmacies. Similarly, the German market often carries German, Hungarian, Polish, and Ukrainian-made varieties of vodka of 90 to 95% ABV. A Bulgarian vodka, Balkan 176°, has an 88% alcohol content. Everclear, an American brand, is also sold at 95% ABV.'},\n",
       " {'ingredient': 'rum',\n",
       "  'description': 'Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses, or directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of the world\\'s rum production occurs in the Caribbean and Latin America. Rum is also produced in Scotland, Austria, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, India, Reunion Island, Mauritius, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, the United States, and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nRums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, on the rocks, or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are also available, made to be consumed either straight or iced.\\r\\n\\r\\nRum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as in The Maritimes and Newfoundland. This beverage has famous associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo). Rum has also served as a popular medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see Triangular trade), organized crime, and military insurgencies (e.g., the American Revolution and Australia\\'s Rum Rebellion).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precursors to rum date back to antiquity. Development of fermented drinks produced from sugarcane juice is believed to have first occurred either in ancient India or in China, and to have spread from there. An example of such an early drink is brum. Produced by the Malay people, brum dates back thousands of years. Marco Polo also recorded a 14th-century account of a \"very good wine of sugar\" that was offered to him in the area that became modern-day Iran.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first distillation of rum took place on the sugarcane plantations of the Caribbean in the 17th century. Plantation slaves first discovered molasses, a byproduct of the sugar refining process, could be fermented into alcohol. Later, distillation of these alcoholic byproducts concentrated the alcohol and removed impurities, producing the first true rums. Tradition suggests rum first originated on the island of Barbados. However, in the decade of the 1620s, rum production was recorded in Brazil. A liquid identified as rum has been found in a tin bottle found on the Swedish warship Vasa, which sank in 1628.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1651 document from Barbados stated, \"The chief fuddling they make in the island is Rumbullion, alias Kill-Divil, and thi is made of sugar canes distilled, a hot, hellish, and terrible liquor.\"'}]"

       "<p>Machine learning is a set of methods that computers use to make and improve predictions or behaviors based on data.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, to predict the value of a house, the computer would learn patterns from past house sales.\n",
       "The book focuses on supervised machine learning, which covers all prediction problems where we have a dataset for which we already know the outcome of interest (e.g. past house prices) and want to learn to predict the outcome for new data.\n",
       "Excluded from supervised learning are for example clustering tasks (= unsupervised learning) where we do not have a specific outcome of interest, but want to find clusters of data points.\n",
       "Also excluded are things like reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to optimize a certain reward by acting in an environment (e.g. a computer playing Tetris).\n",
       "The goal of supervised learning is to learn a predictive model that maps features of the data (e.g. house size, location, floor type, …) to an output (e.g. house price).\n",
       "If the output is categorical, the task is called classification, and if it is numerical, it is called regression.\n",
       "The machine learning algorithm learns a model by estimating parameters (like weights) or learning structures (like trees).\n",
       "The algorithm is guided by a score or loss function that is minimized.\n",
       "In the house value example, the machine minimizes the difference between the estimated house price and the predicted price.\n",
       "A fully trained machine learning model can then be used to make predictions for new instances.</p>\n",
       "<p>Estimation of house prices, product recommendations, street sign detection, credit default prediction and fraud detection:\n",
       "All these examples have in common that they can be solved by machine learning.\n",
       "The tasks are different, but the approach is the same:<br/>\n",
       "Step 1: Data collection.\n",
       "The more, the better.\n",
       "The data must contain the outcome you want to predict and additional information from which to make the prediction.\n",
       "For a street sign detector (“Is there a street sign in the image?”), you would collect street images and label whether a street sign is visible or not.\n",
       "For a credit default predictor, you need past data on actual loans, information on whether the customers were in default with their loans, and data that will help you make predictions, such as income, past credit defaults, and so on.\n",
       "For an automatic house value estimator program, you could collect data from past house sales and information about the real estate such as size, location, and so on.<br/>\n",
       "Step 2: Enter this information into a machine learning algorithm that generates a sign detector model, a credit rating model or a house value estimator.<br/>\n",
       "Step 3: Use model with new data.\n",
       "Integrate the model into a product or process, such as a self-driving car, a credit application process or a real estate marketplace website.</p>\n",
       "<p>Machines surpass humans in many tasks, such as playing chess (or more recently Go) or predicting the weather.\n",
       "Even if the machine is as good as a human or a bit worse at a task, there remain great advantages in terms of speed, reproducibility and scaling.\n",
       "A once implemented machine learning model can complete a task much faster than humans, reliably delivers consistent results and can be copied infinitely.\n",
       "Replicating a machine learning model on another machine is fast and cheap.\n",
       "The training of a human for a task can take decades (especially when they are young) and is very costly.\n",
       "A major disadvantage of using machine learning is that insights about the data and the task the machine solves is hidden in increasingly complex models.\n",
       "You need millions of numbers to describe a deep neural network, and there is no way to understand the model in its entirety.\n",
       "Other models, such as the random forest, consist of hundreds of decision trees that “vote” for predictions.\n",
       "To understand how the decision was made, you would have to look into the votes and structures of each of the hundreds of trees.\n",
       "That just does not work no matter how clever you are or how good your working memory is.\n",
       "The best performing models are often blends of several models (also called ensembles) that cannot be interpreted, even if each single model could be interpreted.\n",
       "If you focus only on performance, you will automatically get more and more opaque models.\n",
       "<!--\n",
       "Just take a look at [interviews with winners on the kaggle.com machine learning competition platform](http://blog.kaggle.com/):\n",
       "-->\n",

      "Machine learning is a set of methods that computers use to make and improve predictions or behaviors based on data. For example, to predict the value of a house, the computer would learn patterns from past house sales. The book focuses on supervised machine learning, which covers all prediction problems where we have a dataset for which we already know the outcome of interest (e.g. past house prices) and want to learn to predict the outcome for new data. Excluded from supervised learning are for example clustering tasks (= unsupervised learning) where we do not have a specific outcome of interest, but want to find clusters of data points. Also excluded are things like reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to optimize a certain reward by acting in an environment (e.g. a computer playing Tetris). The goal of supervised learning is to learn a predictive model that maps features of the data (e.g. house size, location, floor type, …) to an output (e.g. house price). If the output is categorical, the task is called classification, and if it is numerical, it is called regression. The machine learning algorithm learns a model by estimating parameters (like weights) or learning structures (like trees). The algorithm is guided by a score or loss function that is minimized. In the house value example, the machine minimizes the difference between the estimated house price and the predicted price. A fully trained machine learning model can then be used to make predictions for new instances. Estimation of house prices, product recommendations, street sign detection, credit default prediction and fraud detection: All these examples have in common that they can be solved by machine learning. The tasks are different, but the approach is the same: Step 1: Data collection. The more, the better. The data must contain the outcome you want to predict and additional information from which to make the prediction. For a street sign detector (“Is there a street sign in the image?”), you would collect street images and label whether a street sign is visible or not. For a credit default predictor, you need past data on actual loans, information on whether the customers were in default with their loans, and data that will help you make predictions, such as income, past credit defaults, and so on. For an automatic house value estimator program, you could collect data from past house sales and information about the real estate such as size, location, and so on. Step 2: Enter this information into a machine learning algorithm that generates a sign detector model, a credit rating model or a house value estimator. Step 3: Use model with new data. Integrate the model into a product or process, such as a self-driving car, a credit application process or a real estate marketplace website. Machines surpass humans in many tasks, such as playing chess (or more recently Go) or predicting the weather. Even if the machine is as good as a human or a bit worse at a task, there remain great advantages in terms of speed, reproducibility and scaling. A once implemented machine learning model can complete a task much faster than humans, reliably delivers consistent results and can be copied infinitely. Replicating a machine learning model on another machine is fast and cheap. The training of a human for a task can take decades (especially when they are young) and is very costly. A major disadvantage of using machine learning is that insights about the data and the task the machine solves is hidden in increasingly complex models. You need millions of numbers to describe a deep neural network, and there is no way to understand the model in its entirety. Other models, such as the random forest, consist of hundreds of decision trees that “vote” for predictions. To understand how the decision was made, you would have to look into the votes and structures of each of the hundreds of trees. That just does not work no matter how clever you are or how good your working memory is. The best performing models are often blends of several models (also called ensembles) that cannot be interpreted, even if each single model could be interpreted. If you focus only on performance, you will automatically get more and more opaque models.  The winning models on machine learning competitions are often ensembles of models or very complex models such as boosted trees or deep neural networks. \n"
