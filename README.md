## What is it?
NLP4Free is a free online crash course on natural language processing.

## How is it delivered?
The course is comprised of slides, notebooks, and Youtube videos. The former can be viewed online from the links below and also downloaded as PDFs, the latter may be downloaded as `.ipynb` files or run in Google Colab. The playlist for the recorded videos is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Qf6hUAPsl1cyzBgLuM4sZ8uxsjXypj7)

## What is covered?
The course covers the following at a high level, with simple code examples to get the non-technical practitioner unfamiliar with NLP and machine learning started:
- **Part 1 - Introduction to NLP**
